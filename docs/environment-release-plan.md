# Environment setup and release plan

## Target

- Development: local web/API on 3000 and a staging-identity Expo app, using the existing isolated staging Supabase and PowerSync services. Test accounts only. This deliberately shares staging data; freeze development writes while validating a release.
- Staging: hosted `deephaus-staging.vercel.app`, isolated Supabase `cktvxmclcxtymkozciaw`, Launch Staging PowerSync, sandbox billing, and staging workers.
- Production: `www.deephaus.ai`, Supabase `rdfijwmxlyvykcnxfurd`, production PowerSync and Render workers, real billing.

## Development commands

`pnpm dev:web`, `pnpm dev:mobile`, `pnpm mobile:ios`, `pnpm dev:anki`, and `pnpm dev:extraction` load the ignored `.env.launch-staging.local`. Web/API runs on 3000. The existing `launch:*` acceptance runners retain ports 3100/3101 and separate build directories.

The development wrapper drops inherited application credentials, suppresses legacy dotenv fallback, enforces the staging project, and supplies only public values to Expo. AI generation uses mock mode unless a key is explicitly configured in the staging file. Production secrets in old ignored environment files are not used by these commands. Direct `next dev` or `expo start` bypasses these wrappers; use the package scripts.

The staging iOS native scheme is required for native builds. Existing production-app sessions are not migrated into staging. Use staging test accounts.

## Release sequence

1. Capture existing work on `codex/release-environment-setup` and audit files before publishing.
2. Run launch regression tests, web/mobile/worker checks, and a staging production build.
3. Deploy the exact release commit to hosted staging. Validate auth, authenticated study/sync, jobs, and billing paths relevant to the release. Check worker credentials and continuous polling.
4. Refresh the live database ledger. Prepare only the four reviewed launch migrations. Do not blindly push the historical migration directory, merge the Supabase branch, or rewrite the production ledger.
5. Release compatible database, API, and workers in order, recording commit and deployment IDs. Existing installed mobile apps must remain compatible. A TestFlight/App Store release is separate.
6. Configure repeatable release automation only after the initial validated rollout.

The staging build contains staging public configuration: never promote that artifact to the production project. Build the same reviewed commit with production configuration.

## Current gates

- Live read-only inspection on September 16 confirmed production still lacks the four launch migrations. Staging has them. Historical ledger drift remains.
- Supabase staging database is healthy, but branch orchestration still reports `MIGRATIONS_FAILED` from historical replay; it is not a clean branch promotion path.
- Hosted Google sign-in has a documented invalid client-secret issue. Recheck before declaring auth validated.
- Verify separately hosted staging workers and production worker rollout.
- TestFlight signing and fresh Apple sandbox lifecycle validation are separate mobile release gates.
- Production Vercel and Render deployment triggers must be inspected before merging to `main`.

No live production release is certified by this document.
